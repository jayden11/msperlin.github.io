I'm writing a book about processing and modeling financial data with R. The current version of the book is written in portuguese and it was based in my class notes. I'm in the final stages of the publication process. Soon it will be available in amazon.com. Here is the cover of the book (thanks fo [capista](http://capista.com.br/).

After publishing the book in portuguese, I'm working towards its translation to english. I hope I can make it in a couple o months.

I'll keep this part of the blog updated with new information about the book.
