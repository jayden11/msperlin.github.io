Hi there! 

My name is Marcelo Perlin and my day job is assistant professor of Finance in Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, in the city of south of Brazil (Porto Alegre). I received my PhD in Finance from Reading University (ICMA Centre) in 2010 and I have a long experience in doing applied research in Finance. You can find more details about my work in my [personal homepage](https://sites.google.com/site/marceloperlin/).

In the computational side, I fell in love with R the moment I learned to use it. I have a long standing working relationship with Matlab and I was impressed in observing how much easier it was to manipulate and process data with R, once you understand its sintax. I translated all of my finance libraries from Matlab to R, realizing during the process that I was writing R code much faster and mantainable than I would do in Matlab. After that, I was hooked. I'm currently writing a book about R and Finance that I hope to publish soon. The portuguese version should be up in amazon very soon.

In this blog I will write about my CRAN packages and any other ideas about finance and R or research papers that I'm currently working on. The content will be mostly about ways to make the life of a financial data analyst more enjoyable.

Oh, and I'm not researching and teaching, I also love playing tennis and swimming. Fell free to drop me an email at [marceloperlin@gmail.com](marceloperlin@gmail.com).

Best,

Marcelo.
