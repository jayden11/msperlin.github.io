Hi there! 

My name is Marcelo Perlin. I live in city of Porto Alegre, south of Brazil and I work as an assistant professor of Finance in Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). I received my PhD in Finance from Reading University (ICMA Centre, UK) in 2010 and I have a long experience creating computer scripts for applied research in Finance. You can find more details about my past and current work in my [personal homepage](https://sites.google.com/site/marceloperlin/).

In the computational side, I had a working relationship with Matlab since I started to work with research and I was impressed in learning how much easier it was to manipulate and process data with R, once you understand its sintax. I translated all of my finance libraries from Matlab to R, realizing during the process that I was writing R code much faster due to the existing CRAN libraries and, at the same time, the resulting code was easier to maintain. After that, I was hooked. I wrote several CRAN packages and now I'm currently writing a book about R and Finance that I hope to publish soon (see details in top of webpage).

In this blog I will write about my CRAN packages and any other ideas about finance and R or research papers that I'm currently working on. The content will be mostly about ways to make the life of a financial data analyst more enjoyable.

When I'm not researching or teaching, I also love playing tennis and swimming. Fell free to drop me an email at [marceloperlin@gmail.com](marceloperlin@gmail.com).

Best,

Marcelo.
