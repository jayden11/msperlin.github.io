I am happy to announce that my book about R and Finance (in portuguese) is finally available!

The idea of writing a book about R started back in the end of 2015, when I decided to try something different than research papers. Writing a book was the first idea. I studied the current market of R books in Brazil and abroad and just started writing a summary on what I felt was important for anyone with interest in finance and R to learn. My reasoning was that, even if I decided not to publish the material as a book, I would still have good class notes for my graduate students. 

The content of the book started to take a very good shape and I decided to go for the long stretch, self-publishing it in amazon. I had many problems along the way and I learned a lot about the process of editing and publishing a technical book. Long story short, it is not easy, specially for the first time. Writing the content was hard work but I really enjoyed it. Editing the book was far more painfull.

My special thanks to Yihui Xie for his [bookdown package](https://bookdown.org/). Switching all the content of the book from Latex to bookdown (markdown) made the process of editing much easier. There are still some caveats, specially for the Amazon Kindle format, but it worked smoothly most of the time.

Here are the links to the book.
