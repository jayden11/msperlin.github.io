I'm pleased to announce that my book, **Processing and Analyzing Financial Data with R**, is finally ready! The book is a long term project that I always desired to do. It summarises everything that I wish I knew when I started to work with research. I plan on keep working on it as much as I can, adding packages, exercises and slides.

You can find more details about the book, including table of contents, code/data and exercises, in the [website](https://sites.google.com/view/pafdR/home). I also wrote about my experience in writing the book in this [post](https://msperlin.github.io/2017-02-16-Writing-a-book/).

The book is available for purchase in [CreateSpace (paperback)](https://www.createspace.com/7141874) and Amazon ([ebook](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071DTSCPS) or [print](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8592243556)). Following other great titles about R, the online version of the book is freely available with full content in this [link](https://msperlin.github.io/pafdR/). The portuguese version of the book is also freely available [here](https://msperlin.github.io/pmdfR-Online/).

Enjoy!
