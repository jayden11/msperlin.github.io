One of the first examples about the usage of linear regression in
finance is the calculation of betas. The coefficient beta is a measure
of systematic risk and is calculated by estimating a linear model where
the dependent variable is the returns of a stock and the independent is
the returns of market index, such as SP500, FTSE or any other. We can
formulate it as:

*R*<sub>*i*, *t*</sub> = *α*<sub>*i*</sub> + *β*<sub>*i*</sub>*R**M*, *t* + *ϵ*
